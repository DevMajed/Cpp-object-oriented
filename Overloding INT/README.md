# Overloading INT

This is a simple project that i build to understand overloading. \
It has a class INT that behaves like an int (i.e. can be used in expressions with int values) and it implement the postfix and prefix ++ and -- operators, and the += and -= assignment operators.
The Class RINT does the smae thing except that the only operations allowed are + and - (both unary and binary operators), = for assignment of an int to an RINT, and overloaded stream input >> and output << operators for RINT values.
